Rosie O'Donnell is speaking out less than one week after her adopted daughter Chelsea asked for privacy on Twitter.
The duo's strained relationship has been public over the past several months; however, the former View co-host shared her thoughts on the 18-year-old's latest moves on social media.

Rosie posted two photos on Twitter earlier today: one of Chelsea's message to fans asking for them to avoid tagging her estranged mother in posts, and an Instagram collage featuring multiple selfies of Chelsea.
"18 years ago tomorrow—I met my daughter for the first time…a plea 10 days ago…now a photo shoot #choices," Rosie wrote.

Chelsea's plea that Rosie refers to was from Oct. 20 that read: "I don't want to come off rude, that is not my intention. However, I have asked not to be brought into any Rosie drama and that I don't want to hear anything about her. I would appreciate it if anyone who is tagging me or asking me questions about her would please stop. Thank you."

Over the summer, Chelsea and Rosie made headlines after the teen was found at the New Jersey home of 26-year-old Steven Sheerer, who had an arrest record. Police said that Sheerer had met Chelsea previously when she was visiting Long Beach Island.

Rosie used her social media platform to publicize information about Sheerer's past trouble with the law.
And following the Sheerer incident, Rosie opened up to one of her fans when they asked how she was holding up.
"No mom is perfect," she tweeted to a follower. "We all do our best."
